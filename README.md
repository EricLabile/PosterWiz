## ‚è∞TODOs
- [ ] Recaption Anyword-3M and MARIO-10M dataset 
- [ ] Filter the poster from Anyword-3M and MARIO-10M dataset for later fine-tuning
- [ ] Fine-tune a large language model, such as Vicuna-7b-v1.5 for generating position embeddings
- [ ] Fine-tune stable diffusion-v1.5 by using posters and combining Text Perceptual Loss
- [ ] Support PosterWiz in webui(ü§î)
